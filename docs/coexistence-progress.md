# Coexistence implementation ledger

Approved scope: conversation plan approved 2026-09-23. Base: 4e85b3d.
Branch: codex/whatsapp-coexistence. No deployment or live-number onboarding authorized.

## Work sequence

1. Bind one-use signup state to the selected mode; reject mode substitution.
2. Implement verified coexistence authorization and its distinct browser callback.
3. Persist and ingest history, contacts, mobile echoes, and disconnection events.
4. Pause AI on mobile replies, cancel pending sends, guard dispatch, explicit audited resume.
5. Add tenant-isolated status/control UI and durable synchronization orchestration.
6. Run isolated tests and security review; present deployment/pilot readiness separately.

## Constraints

- Keep the release gate closed until all stages pass.
- Never register/deregister an existing Business app number or fall back to API_ONLY.
- Never run tests against the configured production database or start existing workers.
- Use independent test dependencies and a disposable database without real credentials.
- Preserve the checkpoint and other working directories.

## Progress

- Isolated worktree created from the checkpoint; branch created.
- Official Meta coexistence documentation retrieved on 2026-09-23. It confirms a
  distinct completion event, server-side asset resolution, one-shot contacts/history
  synchronization, and mobile echo events. Recheck version-4 launch requirements.
- Isolated test image and pinned development dependencies are ready. Tests run
  without network access or production credentials. A separate disposable database
  has the migrations applied; no production migrations have been applied.
- Signup state now binds the selected mode in the service and database query.
  Contract tests passed after first observing failures. Eleven real-database tests
  now pass: mode/tenant/admin/session binding, expiry boundary, replay, concurrent
  consumption and consumption surviving a callback transaction rollback.
- User authorized resolving baseline scanner false positives on 2026-09-24.
  Renamed runtime credential variables and used destructuring for login form values;
  scanner rules and exclusions are unchanged. Added disposable-repository tests
  proving that literal tokens, passwords, client secrets and private-key headers
  remain blocked, and an innocuous repository passes.
- Server-side authorization now resolves omitted business/phone IDs from Meta.
  Ambiguous or paginated phone selections fail closed. Coexistence requires exact
  phone identity plus boolean is_on_biz_app=true and platform_type=CLOUD_API;
  missing/malformed evidence stays UNKNOWN. New provider cases observed RED/GREEN.
- Browser parser accepts the coexistence-specific completion event with WABA-only
  data, rejects mode substitution and untrusted origins, and preserves API_ONLY
  required fields. Frontend/backend release gates remain CLOSED.
- Latest verification (2026-09-24): 274 backend unit/contract tests passed; 23
  frontend unit tests passed; frontend tsc --noEmit --incremental false passed;
  47 integration tests passed. test_database_gate_removes_stale_schema_state failed
  because isolated image lacks pnpm (environment reset test, not application code).
  Redis conversation-lock tests were excluded; full environment/security DB gates
  remain pending. git diff --check and focused Ruff F checks passed.
- Focused security suite: 65 passed against the disposable database (tenant
  isolation matrix and secret-tenant-isolation suites not included). Initial run
  lacked TEST_DATABASE_URL for human_active_silence; rerun with isolated URL passed.
- Next: version-4 launch options and cancellation/listener cleanup; durable sync
  records and ingestion of history/contacts/mobile echoes; human takeover and
  outbound race protection. No live Meta scripts executed, number connected,
  deployment performed or production migration applied.
- Ruling: use this durable ledger for the conversation-approved plan instead of
  task-script briefs (no machine-formatted plan exists). No scope change.
